ZotSearchNotes

This is a basic script I am using to facilitate my Zotero document workflow.

Requirements:
Zotero https://www.zotero.org/
Zotfile http://zotfile.com/
PyZotero https://pypi.org/project/Pyzotero/
Python 3

In Zotero you need some familiarity with the API set-up and how to get an API key from the website

Go to the ZotFile site and install the Add-on into Zotero
Open up any PDF and highlight the text and/or leaving comments via the PDF annotation tools
After annotating a PDF, right click:manage attachments:extract annotations
A notes file called "Extracted Annotations" will appear as a child attachment to the parent item

On your local machine, you will need to install PyZotero and all of the related steps to have a working
Python development environment

Download ZotSearchNotes.Py
Uncomment line 14 - # searchQuery = sys.argv[1]
If you leave it commented - the searchQuery you put into config.py will be all it ever looks for

Download config_sample.py and rename to config.py
Enter the required info into config.py


Run the script
% python ZotSearchNotes.py {searchterm}

After a minute or two an RTF file should appear in the folder you put in config.py

At the moment you can only search on single terms "innovation" not "journalism innovation"
The RTF encoding is liable to fail on the extracts of some notes.
My Python coding skills are limited, so there are a lot of iterating through lists and other things
that are really inefficient. Oh well.

I have a similar script that exports notes by Library/Collection that I will upload soon.
